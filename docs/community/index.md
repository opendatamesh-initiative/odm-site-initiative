# Community
We are open to all kinds of contributions. If you want to join us, this is the right page. Check out all the possible ways to contribute. We hope to have you on board.

???+ warning
    We want to make contributing to the initiative as easy and transparent as possible. We do not have anyway a formal contribution process like other open initiative yet (ex. <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/spec/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" target="_blank">AsyncAPI Specification Contribution Guide :material-github:</a>). We want to define a lightweight process in the upcoming months collecting also your feedbacks on the different possibilities. 

## Contributing
You can contribute to the initiative in the following ways:

- send an informal feedback through our comunication channels (<a href="https://join.slack.com/t/opendatamesh/shared_invite/zt-1jrqfghls-68AxK_QzypaOeNyOkOwuog" target="_blank">slack :material-slack:</a> and <a href="mailto:odm.info@quantyca.it" target="_blank">mail :octicons-mail-16:</a>)
- open a formal request through <a href="https://github.com/features/issues" target="_blank">github issues</a> on one of the <a href="https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative" target="_blank">initiative's repositories :material-github:</a>
- propose to marge your modifications through <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests" target="_blank">github issues</a> on one of the <a href="https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative" target="_blank">initiative's repositories :material-github:</a>


???+ note
    The **Open Data Mesh Initiative (ODMI)** uses  <a href="https://github.com/opendatamesh-initiative" target="_blank">GitHub :material-github:</a> to manage all its projects.
    
    All repositories are publicly visible; however, if you want to contribute new content you need to create a GitHub account. This can be created from the top of the GitHub home page.
