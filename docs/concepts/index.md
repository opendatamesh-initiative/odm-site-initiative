In this section we want to introduce some general concepts related to the data mesh paradigm and the logical architecture of Open Data Mesh. 

This page anyway IS NOT a data mesh guide.  

Check the [Data Mesh Resources](../resources/dm-resources.md) page to find out better resources to start learning more about data mesh.
