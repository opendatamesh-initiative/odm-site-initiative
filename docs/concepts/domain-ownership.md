# Domain Ownership

The Domain Ownership principle centers around the idea that data should be owned and managed by domain experts, rather than by a centralized data team. Each domain within an organization is responsible for defining and managing its own data. This includes ensuring its quality, security, and accessibility. 

By giving domain experts ownership and control over their own data, organizations can ensure that the data is more accurate, relevant, and actionable. In addition, this fosters a culture of data-driven decision-making as domain experts have a better understanding of how the data is being used and can tailor it to their specific needs. Ultimately, the Domain Ownership principle helps to break down data silos and promote a more collaborative and efficient approach to data management. 

The concepts of decentralization and distribution of responsibility are central to the Data Mesh approach. The aim of this approach is to enable continuous change and scalability by empowering those who are closest to the data. The challenge lies in how to decompose and decentralize the various components of the data ecosystem and their ownership. 

The Data Mesh approach proposes decomposing ownership based on business domains, the same strategy used by companies for organizational structure. This localization helps to contain the impact of continuous change and makes the business domainâ€™s bounded context a good candidate for the distribution of data ownership.
