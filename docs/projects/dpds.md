# Data Product Descriptor Specification

The Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) is the first project launched under the Open Data Mesh Initiative in 2022.

It is a declarative and technology-independent open standard that can be used to describe a data product in all its components through a JSON or YAML document. It allows human agents (e.g. analysts, data scientists, etc..) and digital agents (e.g. other data products, BI tools, planes of the underlying mesh platform, etc..) to operate, discover and access a data product. When properly defined, external agents can understand and interact with the data product with a minimal amount of cognitive load and implementation logic.
