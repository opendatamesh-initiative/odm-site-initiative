# Data Store API Specification

The Data Store API Specification (DSAS) is a project launched within the development of the Data Product Descriptor Specification (DPDS) in 2022.

It defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to a Data API which allows both humans and computers to understand how to establish a connection and query a database service managing tabular data without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote database service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

A Data Store API definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.
